## [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

> **Input**: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9\
> **Output**: [0,1]\
> **Explanation**: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:

> **Input**: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6\
> **Output**: [1,2]

Example 3:

> **Input**: nums = [3,3], target = 6\
> **Output**: [0,1]

Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `-109 <= target <= 109`
- **Only one valid answer exists.**

## Notes

Probably the easiest problem at Leet Code. To solve with time complexity O(nÂ²), just use two loops and compare every combination. Two solve in O(n), use a hash map. By using a hash map, it's possible to store the index and the difference between the current number and the target. This way, it's required to loop the array only once.
